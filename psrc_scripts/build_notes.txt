See instructions in Building.md

One issue is that RStudio needs to be run in admin mode to ensure a build

To add in PSRC survey data, we need to build from scratch after copying in the survey Rda files
The survey Rda files are generated from the scripts here. 
Copy them to VisionEval\sources\modules\VE2001NHTS\data-raw

We need to get the full code (I think) to be able to build?
use the VisionEval_build code for that.

In order to create estimation datasets, use ve.build(express=FALSE)
